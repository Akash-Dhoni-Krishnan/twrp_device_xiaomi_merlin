  ### Important Note

  - Such things as USB-OTG, flashing custom ROMs or ZIPs (other than the OrangeFox itself) with this DT **were not tested yet**
  - Please [open an issue](https://github.com/chickendrop89/orangefox_device_xiaomi_merlin/issues/new) if you have ran into any issue/errors with anything

  ### What does not work yet :(

  - Android 12/12L decryption
  - Torch/Flashlight Feature

  ## ⚠️ **ONLY USE AT YOUR OWN RISK** ⚠️
